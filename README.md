## 4Clojure solutions

My solutions to the [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) problems.

On most problems I have provided more than one solution. Some problems have `special restrictions`. For example, a function which is supposed to count the number of elements in a sequence will not be allowed to use the `count` function. Obviously, this would defeat the purpose. I have also provided the first test for each problem.
